# PROG5001-Assessment-2

## Functional Requirements

- F1: Read Data from Text File
    - The program should read the unit name and students' marks from a given text file.
    - The user will provide the file name.
    - The file contains the unit name and the list of students with their names, student IDs, and marks for three assignments.
    - The file also contains lines that are comments, and the program should ignore them when reading the students' marks.
- F2: Calculate Total Marks
    - The program should calculate the total mark for each student from the assessment marks.
    - It should print out the list of students with their name, student ID, assessment marks, and the total mark.
- F3: Print Students Below Threshold
    - The program should print the list of students with total marks less than a certain threshold.
    - The threshold will be entered from the keyboard by the user.
    - To complete this function requirement, follow these steps:
    - Step 1: Create an algorithm (Algorithm 3) in pseudo code to print the list of students with total marks less than a certain threshold.
    - Step 2: Implement Algorithm 3 based on the pseudo code developed in Step 1.
    - Note that the implementation must be in line with the pseudo code, and existing searching and sorting library functions are not allowed in Algorithm 3.
- F4: Print Top 5 and Bottom 5 Students
    - The program should print the top 5 students with the highest total marks and the top 5 students with the lowest total marks.
    - To complete this function requirement, follow these steps:
    - Step 1: Create an algorithm (Algorithm 4) in pseudo code to print the top 5 students with the highest total marks and the top 5 students with the lowest total marks.
    - Step 2: Implement Algorithm 4 based on the pseudo code developed in Step 1.
    - Note that the implementation must be in line with the pseudo code, and existing searching and sorting library functions are not allowed in Algorithm 4.
- F5: Menu System
    - Create a simple menu system to allow users to select and execute each function.
